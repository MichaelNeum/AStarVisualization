 * 1. mark all the nodes as unvisited

 * 2. calculate tentative distance for every node
 *      (0 start node and infinity for all others)
 *      set start as current
 * 3. get neighbors of current
 *      set their parents to current
 *      calc tentative score for each of them and add
 *      tentative score of current and current to neighbor
 * 4. mark the current node as visited
 *      remove it from unvisited set (will never be checked again)
 * 5. if the smallest tentative score is infinite or goal has been marked visited => stop
 *     otherwise select node with smallest tentative score => set it as current, continue at 3
